Tasks from Algorithms and data structures course, originally from https://szkopul.edu.pl/.
All written in C++, each in a single file (due to platform-specific automatic testing).

The use of basic as well as more advanced algorithms and data structures is demonstrated here:
- fibonacci heap
- queue, priority queue
- vector, set, unordered_set
- hashing
- trees
- sorting
- string operations
